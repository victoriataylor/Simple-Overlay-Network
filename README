use make to build

The 4 hosts used to build overlay network is
tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu
spruce.cs.dartmouth.edu
stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu
wildcat.cs.dartmouth.edu

The overlay process should be running on these four hosts
to start overlay on a host:
goto overlay directory and run ./overlay&
All overlay process should be started within 1 min.

After all the overlay processes are started, start the network processes on all 4 nodes.
The network process should be started after the local overlay network is initialized and 
shows "Overlay: waiting for connection from SNP process..."
to start network layer on a host:
goto network directory and run ./network

To kill the overlay processes and network processes: use kill -s 2 processID

If the ports used by the program are used already, the program will exit.

Assumptions: 
	No host has a hostID equal to 0. 

	There are no repeats in the topology.dat file- this would lead to the program believing certain hosts have more neighbors than they actually do.

	topology.dat must be in the format given to us, specifically with three columns (two for the host and one for the edge case). If there are insufficient columns, strtok will pull NULL from the file and the application could segfault.
